            We aim to be the one place where patients can find the right doctor.
            This is our primary goal and as the second step we help in making
            your visit happen with ease. If the doctor/clinic/hospital only has
            a walk-in facility, we help patients by providing the address and
            phone number.

            We have no special tie-ups, relationship or consideration with
            doctors in this regard as we want to be an independent unbiased site
            for patients. Through Practo, your chances of booking an appointment
            are the same as using any other means.
